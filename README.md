# Wikipedia Rating Project Theme

This is the repository for the Wikipedia Rating Project Theme.  It is meant to be paired with the [Wikipedia Rating Project Plugin](https://github.com/mjbuckley/wikipedia-rating-project-plugin).  Installing this theme along with the plugin will give you are working reviews site with almost no setup required.  To learn more about the Wikipedia Rating Project, please see the project [home page](http://mjbuckley.github.io/wikipedia-rating-project).


### Installation Requirements

1. A working WordPress installation with the Wikipedia Rating Project Plugin already installed and set up.
  * [Guide to installing WordPress](https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress)
  * [Wikipedia Rating Project Plugin](https://github.com/mjbuckley/wikipedia-rating-project-plugin)
2. An admin username and password for your WordPress site.
3. A site title.  This is different from your URL.  You should have entered one when first installed WordPress.  If not, go into the WordPress settings page and add one.
  * [Site title information](https://codex.wordpress.org/Settings_General_Screen)


### Installation

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/mjbuckley/wikipedia-rating-project-theme/releases/latest) of the theme.  The file will be downloaded in a compressed .zip format.  Do not unzip the file as WordPress will expect the files to be in a compressed format.
2. Login to your WordPress site as a user with admin privileges.
3. On the left hand side of the admin dashboard, click on the "Appearance" link.  This should bring up the Themes page, but if not, click on "Themes" in the submenu below "Appearance."
4. Click on the "Add New" near the top of the page.
5. Click on "Upload Theme", also near the top of the page.
6. Click on "Choose File."  Navigate to and then select the .zip file that you just downloaded.
7. Click the "Install Now" button.
8. Once the installation is complete, click on the "Activate" link.


### Setup

Five pages are automatically created when you install the theme.  Each plays an important role in the functioning of the site.  If you delete or change the title of these pages you will lose important functionality.  However, be sure to edit the content of these pages to suit your needs, as the current content primarily consists of example text.  The Pages added are:

* About: This is the place to give more detailed information about your site, some contact information, and the requirements to contribute.
* A page with the same name as your site title: This page has been set as your home page.  Any text you enter here will show up in the grey box on the front page of your site.  You can provide as much information here as you wish, but it is meant to be a brief introduction.  Additional information should go on the About page.
* Titles: This page displays a list of all reviewed Wikipedia article titles on the site and provides links to view reviews sorted by title.  The individual titles will not be visible in the page editor, but they will appear on the site.  Any content you add in the page editor will precede the reviewed titles when displayed.
* Ratings: This page lists all of the rating terms used on the site and provides links to view reviews sorted by rating term.  The individual rating terms will not be visible in the page editor, but they will appear on the site.  Any content you add will precede the rating terms when displayed.
* Disciplines: This page lists all of the disciplines used on the site and provides links to view reviews sorted by discipline.  The individual disciplines will not be visible in the page editor, but they will appear on the site.  Any content you add will precede the disciplines when displayed.


### Notes

Although this theme is a fully functional WordPress theme, it was built to be the presentation layer for a review site, not a general purpose WordPress theme.  We hope to add features that expand the general purpose usefulness of the theme in the future, but for now it's not meant to be a stand alone theme.

This theme has been designed not to accept or display comments.  This could change in the future, but for now they are not present.  However, it still might be a good idea to disable comments in your WordPress settings.

A fresh WordPress installation contains a "Sample Page" page, a "Hello world!" post, and an example comment by "Mr. Wordpress."  You probably want to delete these if you haven't already.

Before considering additional features, the immediate plan for the theme is to improve code quality, remove bugs, and improve the design.  Expect the site design to change in the near future, but the overall site functionality should be relatively similar.  We welcome suggestions for the future, but for now we want to focus on improving the current code base.

Automatic theme updates are currently not enabled, so be sure to check back to find future improvements.
